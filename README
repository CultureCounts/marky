Execution Configuration Description
===================================

To be decided, currently pretty amorphous!

TODO:
=====

- experiment aggregation
- benchmarks in different dirs
- benchmarks that vary by changing config files
- speedup calculations
- support for different outputs (csv, R's shitty input format/gnuplot (nsv, basically))
- extra statistics (stdev, standard error, confidence intervals)
- graph output
- experiment aliases
- benchmark grouping?
- logging
- saving of raw outputs
