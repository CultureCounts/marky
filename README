Execution Configuration Description
===================================

To be decided, currently pretty amorphous!

TODO:
=====

non-urgent:
- graph output
- support for simply running programs without a given benchmark to execute
- support for timing of benchmarks, with no filtering of benchmark output
- support for verifying experiment correctness
- support for compiling benchmarks
- support for organising description files
- support for other outputs (R's shitty input format/gnuplot (nlsv, basically))
- extra statistics (stdev, standard error, confidence intervals) (mainly can be provided by pluggin in numpy)
