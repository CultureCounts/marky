marky
=====

usage: marky.py [-h] [--save FILE] [--print] [--email ADDRESS]
                [--email-format {pprint,json}] [--mailserver HOST]
                FILE

marky - a benchmark execution and statistics gathering framework

positional arguments:
  FILE                  A file containing an execution configuration. (Minus
                        the .py)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --save FILE, -s FILE  Output the results into a JSON file.
  --print, -p           "Pretty-print" the results.
  --email ADDRESS, -m ADDRESS
                        Send an email to the address once complete. (Uses
                        localhost unless --mailserver is given.)

                        Choose between pprint and json for the format of the
                        data sent in the email.

Execution Configuration Description
===================================

To be decided, currently pretty amorphous!

TODO:
=====

- experiment aggregation DONE
- benchmarks in different dirs
- benchmarks that vary by changing config files
- speedup calculations
- support for different outputs (csv, R's shitty input format/gnuplot (nsv, basically))
- extra statistics (stdev, standard error, confidence intervals)
- graph output
- experiment aliases
- benchmark grouping?
- logging
- saving of raw outputs
