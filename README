Execution Configuration Description
===================================

To be decided, currently pretty amorphous!

TODO:
=====

- benchmarks in different dirs
- benchmarks that vary by changing config files
- speedup calculations
- support for different outputs (csv, R's shitty input format/gnuplot (nlsv, basically))
- extra statistics (stdev, standard error, confidence intervals)
- graph output
- experiment aliases
- benchmark grouping?

- experiment aggregation DONE
- saving of raw outputs DONE-albeit horrifically, needs experiment aliases/grouping to look nice
- debug logging DONE
