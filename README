Execution Configuration Description
===================================

To be decided, currently pretty amorphous!

TODO:
=====

- support for reading benchmark arguments from a script in the benchmark's directory
- speedup calculations (proper ones)
- support for other outputs (R's shitty input format/gnuplot (nlsv, basically))
- extra statistics (stdev, standard error, confidence intervals)
- graph output
- checking that the description file has the required variables
- support for loading json files for aggregation, presentation, etc
- support for organising description files
- support for simply running programs without a given benchmark to execute
- support for timing of benchmarks, with no filtering of benchmark output
- support for verifying experiment correctness
- support for compiling benchmarks
- support for describing the experiments that would be run

- experiment aggregation DONE
- saving of raw outputs DONE
- debug logging DONE
- benchmark grouping DONE
- benchmarks in different dirs DONE
- experiment aliases DONE
- support for different outputs - csv DONE
- support for disabling aggregate calculation DONE
- support for a warmup run before each benchmark's proper runs DONE
- benchmarks that vary by changing config files DONE
